# RepresentationGraphBuilder
Python program modules for building Representation Graphs for gene regulatory network state spaces created using Hybrid System Model (HSM) framework.

## Getting started

Clone this repository locally and run Python scripts from the `bin` directory. It contains two scripts: 

- `build_rgraphs_file.py`: builds representation graph for the given input file
- `build_rgraphs_all.py`: builds representation graphs for all input files from the given directory

## Requirements

The scripts have been tested with Python release versions 3.8.1 and 3.10.12 on Windows and Ubuntu Linux operating systems, compatibility with range of other Python 3.0 versions could be expected. 
The scripts require the following Python packages to be inatalled: `NumPy`, `NetworkX`, `igraph` and `N2G` (and have been tested specifically with the package versions: `numpy-1.24.4`, `netwrokx-3.1`, `igraph-0.11.4` and `N2G-0.3.3`).   

## Usage

For computing representation graph for the given input file:

```
python build_rgraphs_file.py -i <source file> -o <destination file (graph)> [-draw <destination file (graphml)>] [-ini] [-s]
```

where:

- `<source file>`: the input file containing HSM model state space graph in syntactically right format
- `<destination file (graph)>`: the output file containing representation graph and its attractors 
- `<destination file (graphml)>` (optional): the output file containing visualisations of representation graph and attractors in graphml format (can be viewed and edited with e.g. yEd Graph Editor)  
- `-ini` (optional): if provided, compute representation graph only for the part of the state space from the given initial state (INI state should be included in input file) 
- `-s` (optional): run silently

For computing representation graphs for all input files from the given directory:

```
python build_rgraphs_all.py <source dir> <destination dir> [-draw] [-ini]
```

This calls `build_rgraphs_file.py` script for all files in input directory `<source dir>` and saves its output in `<destination dir>`.
The both directories should exist and `<source dir>` should contain only syntactically correct HSM model state space graph files. The arguments `-draw` and `-ini`, if provided, are passed to `build_rgraphs_file.py` script.
The naming conventions of files are as follows: the representation graph of input file `filname.*` will be saved in file `filname_rg.txt`, 
the drawing of representation graph will be saved in file `filename_rg.graphml`.   

## Examples

The `models` directory contains sample input and output files for lambda phage, HK022 phage and Mu phage viruses HSM models, and for myeloid cell differentiation model 
(for meaningful results the latter should be analysed with `-ini` flag). The input files of HSM state spaces have been generated by programs from
[https://github.com/IMCS-Bioinformatics/HybridSystemModels](https://github.com/IMCS-Bioinformatics/HybridSystemModels) repository. 
Sample visualisations of the obtained representation graphs by yEd Graph Editor (after applying cosmetic layout changes and node groupings) are shown below.

## Input file format

The program accepts as input files of gene regulatory network state spaces described by labelled graphs in simple text-based format. The input format is tailored for state space graphs of GRN models defined using HSM framework, but might be semantically compatible with descriptions of discrete GRN state spaces modelled by other formalisms.

An initial fragment of a sample input file is shown below. The lines with the first printable character being `#` are treated as comments and ignored. The semantics and syntax requirements of individual fields are outlined in the tables below. The current version of the program does not provide syntax checking and protection against errors in input files.
